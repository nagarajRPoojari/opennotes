Hi! I’m **Nagaraj Poojari**, currently working as a Software Engineer at **IBM India Software Labs**.  

I started my software journey ~5 years ago as a CS undergrad at RIT Bangalore. I am good at Go, 
Python, C, blah blah..  & solving problems using fundamental thinking.

I have this strange habbit of building things from scratch, not to reinvent, but to learn. So, you will 
see me building some random stuffs all the time.

## I am good at
1. languages: [go](), [python](), [c]().
2. data stuffs: [mysql](), [redis](), [kafka](), [elasticsearch]().
3. analystic: [kibana](), [grafana]().
4. containers to cluster: [docker](), [podman](), [k8s](), [k8s-operator](), [rancher](), [helm]().
5. bit of CI/CD: [github-actions]().
6. OS: [linux]().
7. Cloud services: [aws-ec2](), [aws-lambda](), [aws-s3]() etc..
8. API: [gRPC](), [fastapi]().
9. graphics: [opengl](), [shaders]().

## Had worked with
1. languages: [java](), [javascript](), [c++]().
2. Frontend techs: [html](), [css](), [react]().
3. Backend frameworks: [node.js](), [express.js]().
4. data science & ML: [scikit-learn](), [tensorflow](), [pytorch](), [huggingface](), [langchain]().
5. Quantum computing: [qiskit](), [pennylane]().
6. Miscl tools: [bazel](), [Make/CMake](), [LLVM]().

I can keep on mentioning ton of other libraries though I am not expert, but a big fan of.

I do have good knowledge in [distributed-systems](), [databases](), [network-programming](), [compilers]() & my interest 
revolves around the same. As part of my hobby, i had explored [game-dev](), [graphics](), [quantum-computing]().. many more.
