Welcome to **Open Notes**.

Hi, I am Nagaraj. 
I work as a software engineer at IBM. I am a hobbyist developer & a sketch artist.
I love breaking & building software stuffs, so occasionally I try to put my 
thoughts into a proper structure & dump it here.

I am not good at writing; you will find a ton of gramatic errors, but I constantly try to improve myself & 
keep this site away from AI slop.

More about my technical background [here]({{< ref "about.md" >}}).
